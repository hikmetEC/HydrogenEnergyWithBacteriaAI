# 🌱 AI-Powered Hydrogen Production Simulation

This project presents an **AI-assisted simulation** for predicting hydrogen production efficiency using environmental factors such as temperature, light intensity, pH, and nutrient concentration.  
It supports the idea of combining **biological hydrogen generation (e.g., _Rhodobacter sphaeroides_)** with **artificial intelligence** to monitor and analyze performance **without any real biological manipulation**.

## 🚀 Overview

Hydrogen is one of the most promising clean energy carriers.  
Traditional electrolysis-based production suffers from energy losses, while biological production offers a greener path.  
This project proposes using **machine learning** to simulate and predict hydrogen yield based on environmental conditions, helping optimize processes safely through **data and simulation** only.

## 🧠 Features

- Generates **synthetic (simulated) data** for safe experimentation  
- Uses **Random Forest Regressor** to predict hydrogen yield  
- Visualizes predictions vs. true simulated values  
- Allows custom input to test various parameter combinations  
- Runs entirely locally, without real lab or biological data
